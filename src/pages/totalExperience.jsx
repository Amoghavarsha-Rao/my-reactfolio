									I played a pivotal role in advancing the
									technological landscape through my
									contributions to the development and
									enhancement of a cash-ordering module for
									the central treasury portal, 'SinglePoint.'
									Leveraging React.js and U.S. Bankâ€™s React
									component library, 'Shield,' I orchestrated
									a 25% surge in pilot customer engagement by
									crafting an intuitive and streamlined user
									interface. This optimization not only

									methodologies with Postman, ensuring
									seamless validation of APIs and guaranteeing
									robust functionality and integration.
								</li>
								<li>
									Demonstrating proficiency in version
									control, I utilized Git and Gitlab for
									effective code collaboration. Employing
									advanced branching and merging strategies, I
									streamlined the development process and
									ensured code integrity.
								</li>
								<li>
