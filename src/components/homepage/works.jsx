									component library, 'Shield,' I orchestrated
									a 25% surge in pilot customer engagement by
									crafting an intuitive and streamlined user
									interface. This optimization not only
									enhanced convenience but also increased
									accessibility in cash transactions.
								</li>
								<li>
									My commitment extended to the maintenance
									and contribution to the 'Shield' component
									library, where I harmonized development
									workflows. My active involvement ensured
									coherence across various projects by
									employing a robust tech stack, including
									HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and SASS. This
									meticulous engagement guaranteed consistency
									and scalability in design across multiple
									projects.
								</li>
								<li>
									Participating in code reviews became a
									cornerstone of my approach, fostering a
									collaborative and learning-oriented
									environment. I implemented rigorous testing
									methodologies with Postman, ensuring
									seamless validation of APIs and guaranteeing
									robust functionality and integration.
								</li>
								<li>
									Demonstrating proficiency in version
									control, I utilized Git and Gitlab for
									effective code collaboration. Employing
									advanced branching and merging strategies, I
									streamlined the development process and
									ensured code integrity.
								</li>
								<li>
									Leveraging SonarQube, I enforced coding
